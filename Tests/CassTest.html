      Now to go into some more detail, <br><br>
      <h6>1. Alan Turing</h6>
      Alan Turing was one of the original inventors of modern computers. Originally educated
      as a mathematician, he went on to help the British Intelligence Service develop
      several predecessors to modern computers, with the aim of decrypting enemy intelligence
      during WW2, thus making him arguably the most influential figure in the field of
      cryptography. Unfortunately despite his astonishing contributions, the British Government
      at the time thanked him by prosecuting him for homosexual activity and chemically
      castrating him, leading to his tragic suicide. <br>
      <h6>2. Grace Hopper</h6>
    </div>
    Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper entered the field of Computer Science near the end
    of WW2, and pioneered some of Computer Scientists most important concepts, and popularized
    the now familliar idea of programming languages independent from the machine they
    were written for, in fact she was the creator of of COBOL, one of the first high-level
    languages, and the only from that time still in usage today. 
    <h6>3.Tim Berners-Lee</h6>
    Tim Berners-Lee has done many things throughout his life, but definitely his most
    famous, and most influential, was the invention of the World Wide Web, proposing
    the initial idea early 1989, and creating a working prototype within the year. Today
    he is still active within the field, and is currently campaigning to make major
    changes to the way in which the internet currently exists. 
    <h6>4. Ada Lovelace</h6>
    Ada Lovelace was not a Computer Scientist in traditional terms, given that she died
    halfway through the 1800's she had little opportunity to interact with computers
    as we would recognise them today, however it would be difficult to argue against
    her being one of the most influencial early figures in the field. A mathematician
    at her core, Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the inventor of the algorithm,
    a concept vitally integrall to how computers work today. &nbsp; 
    <h6>5. Steve Wozniak</h6>
    Co-founder of Apple back in 1976, Wozniak is often considered to be the real genius
    behind the company, which was responsible for creating some of the earliest computers
    designed for every day use rather than as exclusively specialist equipment. He designed
    all of the products released by the company over the first decade. Since then he
    has worked in a number of areas within the field, and today works in data visualisation.
    <h6>6. Edsger W. Dijkstra</h6>
    One of the most important contributors to theoretical computer science, Dijkstra
    has created a number of useful and interesting theories and algorithms, most famously
    being the author of Dijkstra's Algorithm, a solution to the Travelling Salesman
    problem that involves finding the shortest route around a weighted network.&nbsp;
