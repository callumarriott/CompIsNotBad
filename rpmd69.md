## Interest of content - Excellent:
* Most of the pages were filled with lots of information and the author descriptions were informative (I'm sure James' website would have been interesting aswell if he kept up with its annual payments). 

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Good:
* While the quality was very good the formatting of some pages differed quite a bit to others

## Quality of written presentation - Excellent:
* Only some spelling errors but everything else was very good

## Validity of HTML - Good:
* 21 errors found on a HTML validator

## Evidence of collaboration - Good:
* There was evidence of author info not being written by others, however, some people clearly didn't contribute as much as others
